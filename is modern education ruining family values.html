        <h1>Is Modern Education ruining family values?</h1>
        <h3>Article by: Kashaan Mahmood</h3>
        <h2 class="in_italics">(This is the essay I wrote for a local essay competition in Pakistan.Result still awaited.Fingers crossed!)</h2>
        <p>Let us start by the admission that Modern Education is in a process of changing our Mindset ( Notice I have deliberately avoided using the term “ruining” as it carries negative connotations and after presenting a fact-based pro-Modern Education argument I hope to clear away many misconceptions.)</p>
        <p>According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan, Pakistan’s Literacy rate for 2018 stands at 58% [i] which is 20% higher than War-torn Afghanistan and 16% Lower than Over-populated India[ii]. The government of Pakistan has defined literacy as</p>
        <p>“Ability to read and understand a simple text in any language from a newspaper or magazine, write a simple letter and perform a basic mathematical calculation (i.e., counting and addition/subtraction).”[iii]</p>
        <p>The definition of Modern literacy given by UNESCO is

            “The modern term’s meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images, computers, and other basic means to understand, communicate, gain useful knowledge, solve mathematical problems and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture.”[iv]
            
            A Side by side comparison of above mentioned two definitions clearly shows what a developed country such as Russia means by literacy and what a developing country like Pakistan means by the same term.</p>
        <p>In a country where almost 42% of the population cannot read or write how is one supposed to criticize Modern Education when one is well aware that almost half the population of Pakistan is not educated?</p>
        <p>Also, Family values of our society are facing change. We no longer idealize large family units instead we prudently opt for a nuclear family. Most of us do not want our kids to go to Madrassas to learn Persian and Arabic texts; instead, we want them to go to private schools to learn English and Sciences so that they grow up to have successful careers with a better living standard.</p>
        <p>Pakistan is the third largest English speaking country[v]. This shows her inherent thirst for knowledge; for why would a nation leave aside other affairs for learning a foreign language? It is to become knowledgeable about the present and be of merit to the world.</p>
        <p>Our society (without any discrimination amongst rich and poor) holds everything western with deep reverence. We are awed by their scientific, technological progress. We give our blood, sweat, and tears to give our children the opportunity to get educated in a foreign university. We watch with fascination their movies and hold their ideals of a society to be of utmost merit, never surpassed by previous civilizations. We pay lip service to Islam but we do not bother to read for ourselves only be it the Quran. For how can we as a country prosper if we rock the boat on either side?</p>
        <p>But one cannot be fair-minded and turn a blind eye to social evils. Old age homes are rapidly erecting in the twin cities[vi]. Old folks living in such shelters invariably end up unloved, detached, lonely and even depressed. Female education is a critical factor for the success of a country but we do not see any true appreciation of this reality among our current leadership. Check and balance system to corruption is in shambles and holistically much can be criticized.</p>
        <p>Family values such as respect for elders, honesty, Courtesy, self-respect, empathy for others, Compliance to established customs, a sense of responsibility towards others etc., are not considered part of Education rather they are a part of a person’s upbringing. A teacher has a profound influence on his pupils but that is again in his individual role and not as a part of the education curriculum.</p>
        <p>Now that being said I must come back to the fact that Modern Education has an influence on Family values. People delaying marriages until they consider themselves settled in their life and career, Educated people having radical opinions about childbearing (due to fast growing population), Religious rituals and practices (such as Grave worship etc.) and life, in general, are testament to the fact that only the century ago most people used to get married in the early twenties, family had precedence to career.</p>
        <p>If Modern Education is taken to mean the education that one person obtains from Schools, Colleges, Universities and other such Institutions then picking out Modern Education as the sole culprit for this change in family values is unfair treatment. It is unfair because a person is influenced by his friends, family, Media, Social Media and culture and these all have a combined influence on what society has accepted as family values.</p>
        <p>Mass media tells us what to watch, what to wear, what to eat, which celebrity to idealize, what to think (In short how to live our life, which is exactly the domain of Islam!, the only way of life that guarantees sustainable happiness)

            Mass media culture has its merits. We are more connected and aware of present happenings now than ever before. But economic interests are in the driving seat which sometimes vetoes other interests such as Public awareness.</p>
        <p>I remember PTV used to air Raju Meena cartoons with the intent of moral education in mind. We no longer see such programs instead entertainment has taken precedence over moral education, which is why the blame for deteriorating family values rests heavily on shoulders of Mass Media Culture.

            If there has to be a thesis statement of my essay it has to be this-Although Modern Education does have an influence on Traditional Family values but it is incomparable to the influence of Mass Media culture on Traditional Family values.</p>
